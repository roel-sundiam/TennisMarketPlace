<p>Choosing your first tennis racquet is one of the most important decisions you'll make as a new tennis player in the Philippines. With our tropical climate, high humidity, and unique playing conditions, Filipino tennis players need racquets that can perform well in challenging weather while being affordable and accessible.</p>

<p>In this comprehensive guide, we'll review the 10 best tennis racquets for beginners available in the Philippines, compare prices from local retailers, and help you make the perfect choice for your tennis journey.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Great Beginner Tennis Racquet?</h2>
<p>Before diving into our top recommendations, let's understand what makes a tennis racquet perfect for beginners in the Philippines:</p>

<h3>Power vs Control Balance</h3>
<p>Beginner players need racquets that provide <strong>power without sacrificing too much control</strong>. Look for racquets with larger head sizes (100-110 square inches) that offer a bigger sweet spot for more forgiving shots.</p>

<h3>Weight Considerations</h3>
<p>In the Philippines' hot and humid climate, a lighter racquet (260-280 grams) reduces fatigue during long practice sessions at outdoor courts like those in Makati Sports Club or Rizal Memorial Tennis Center.</p>

<h3>String Pattern and Tension</h3>
<p>Open string patterns (16x19) help generate spin, which is crucial for controlling shots on fast hard courts common in Metro Manila tennis facilities.</p>
