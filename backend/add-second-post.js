<h2>💡 Essential Tips for Filipino Tennis Beginners</h2>

<h3>🎾 Grip Size Matters</h3>
<p>Choose the right grip size for comfort. Most Filipino adults use grip size 2 (4 1/4") or 3 (4 3/8"). You should be able to fit your index finger between your palm and fingers when gripping the racquet.</p>

<h3>🏃 Start Light</h3>
<p>A lighter racquet (under 280g) helps you learn proper technique without straining your arm. This is especially important in our hot climate where fatigue sets in quickly.</p>

<h3>🎾 Practice Consistently</h3>
<p>Focus on forehand and backhand basics before jumping into matches. Many Manila tennis clubs offer beginner-friendly group lessons for ₱500-800 per session.</p>

<h3>🌡️ Consider the Weather</h3>
<p>In the Philippines' humid climate, choose racquets with good ventilation and grips that don't slip when wet. Always carry extra overgrips in your tennis bag.</p>
