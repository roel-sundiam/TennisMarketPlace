After consulting with coaches from major tennis clubs across Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao, this comprehensive guide will help you make an informed decision that enhances your game while considering local conditions.

**Key Insight:** The right racket for Philippine conditions balances performance with durability against heat, humidity, and varied court surfaces commonly found throughout the country.

## Understanding Philippine Tennis Conditions

### Climate Challenges
**High Humidity (70-85% year-round):**
- Affects string tension and racket feel
- Increases grip slipperiness during play
- Impacts equipment storage and maintenance

**Extreme Heat (28-38°C):**
